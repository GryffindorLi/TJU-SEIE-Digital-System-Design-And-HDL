# TJU-SEIE-Digital-System-Design-And-HDL
## Code for Digital-System-Design-And-HDL(ALL CODE IN VHDL!!!)
There are 3 projects in this course. 

+ The first project is that design a voter using 4 different grammars, if, case, choose and condition.
+ The second one is to design a traffic light that controls the cross road. The code for this assignment is in the file 'traffic_light'.
+ In the final project, you can choose either to design a controller for household appliances such as vans, air conditioners and microwave ovens, or you can choose to design an elevator controller for a building that has at least 4 floors. What I choose is a van controller, and the code is in the file 'final project'.
